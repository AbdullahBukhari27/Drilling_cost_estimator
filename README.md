Drilling Cost Estimation App

A simple yet powerful AI-powered web app that predicts drilling costs using Linear Regression. Built as a skill showcase by Abdullah Bukhari, this app demonstrates the potential of machine learning in petroleum engineering.This is a machine learning web application that predicts the estimated drilling cost based on geological and operational parameters.

🔍 Purpose

This app was created as a skill showcase by petroleum engineering student combining Artificial Intelligence with real-world drilling data (synthetic/hypothetical). It helps estimate costs quickly and make data-driven decisions in drilling operations.

🚀 Features

 📊 Input features include:
  - Depth (in feet)
  - Mud Type
  - Rig Type
  - Formation Type
  - Hole Size (in inches)
 📈 Outputs the estimated drilling cost (in USD)
- Built using *Streamlit* for frontend, and *scikit-learn* for machine learning
-  Easy-to-use interface for petroleum engineers

 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Joblib (for saving/loading models)

⚠ Note

This app uses synthetic (fake) data for demonstration purposes. It's not meant for actual field operations unless trained on real industry data.
